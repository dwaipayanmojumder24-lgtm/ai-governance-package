## Core Project Mission & Architecture
This workspace contains the **Enterprise AI Governance Package** — an automated Policy-as-Code and CI/CD validation engine that plugs into any AI project to guarantee regulatory compliance, safety, and copyright clearance.

### Key Components
1. **16 Enterprise Policies:** [`baseline/policies/`](file:///c:/ai-governance-package/baseline/policies/) (`POL-SEC` for cybersecurity, `POL-IPR` for copyright/licensing, `POL-DAT` for data privacy, etc.).
2. **60 Baseline Controls:** [`baseline/controls/`](file:///c:/ai-governance-package/baseline/controls/) across 16 domains with ISO 42001, NIST AI RMF, and EU AI Act mappings.
3. **1-Minute Developer Kit:** [`project-kit/init.py`](file:///c:/ai-governance-package/project-kit/init.py) (auto-scaffolds `governance-cards/data-card.yaml` and `ai-project-manifest.yaml`).
4. **Automated PR & Code Gate:** [`plugins/pull-request/ai_code_review_gate.py`](file:///c:/ai-governance-package/plugins/pull-request/ai_code_review_gate.py) (blocks AGPL/GPL copyleft violations and unreviewed AI code).
5. **4 Autonomous Governance Agents:** [`agents/`](file:///c:/ai-governance-package/agents/) (Intake, Resolver, Enforcement, Monitoring).
6. **Multi-Industry Sample Projects:**
   * [`sample-ai-project/`](file:///c:/ai-governance-package/sample-ai-project/) (Baseline Customer Support AI)
   * [`sample-loan-approval-risk/`](file:///c:/ai-governance-package/sample-loan-approval-risk/) (Credit Underwriting - Demographic Disparity Failure & Fix)
   * [`sample-medical-triage-ai/`](file:///c:/ai-governance-package/sample-medical-triage-ai/) (Emergency Triage - Human Clinician Override Failure & Fix)
   * [`sample-financial-advisor/`](file:///c:/ai-governance-package/sample-financial-advisor/) (Wealth Management)
   * [`sample-hr-resume-screening/`](file:///c:/ai-governance-package/sample-hr-resume-screening/) (Recruiting Screener)
7. **Executive Management Presentation:** [`AI_Governance_Novice_Guide.html`](file:///c:/ai-governance-package/AI_Governance_Novice_Guide.html) (14-slide executive slide deck with PDF export, Dark/Light modes, and Q&A Appendix).

## User Interaction Guidelines & Tone
1. **Simple, Concise, and Precise:** The user values clean, plain-English answers without obtuse technical jargon.
2. **Always Link Files:** Always provide clickable links using github-style markdown `file:///` format with forward slashes.
3. **Continuous GitHub Sync:** Maintain synchronization with the remote repository:
   * Remote: `https://github.com/dwaipayanmojumder24-lgtm/ai-governance-package.git`
   * Branch: `main`
